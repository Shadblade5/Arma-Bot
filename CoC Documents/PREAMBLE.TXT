This Unit aspires to provide a satisfying player experience and as such, these Codes of Conduct have been adopted to ensure the following:

1: Players are given an immersive and challenging ARMA 3 gaming experience.
2: All members are treated respectfully inside and outside operations.
3: Administrators, and those with administrative responsibilities, have clearly defined guidelines as to what their roles are, and their discretionary boundaries.

These Codes of Conduct cannot reasonably define all behaviors which would be considered by a reasonable person to be unacceptable. Behaviors which would be considered unacceptable by a reasonable person, or in defiance of a law or term of service, but not defined within these Codes of Conduct would still be acted upon as a violation under a common sense standard.

These Codes have been organized into 7 sections; Preamble with Basic Definitions, 1 General Conduct, 2 Operational Conduct, 3 Campaign/Operation/Modlist Design, 4 Campaign/Operation Signup, 5 Administrative Duties, and 6 Discipline.
